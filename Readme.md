A simple node module for connecting to a Novell Groupwise Server using SOAP.
It was written primarily for the purpose of get a "Resource" calendar's events to display on a touch panel outside a room.

07May2015:
Currently this module is not fully functioning. Do not use until notified.
This is my very first public module, so it may have lots of issues and not well written. Its a learning process.

---------------------

How To Use:

(Note: you will need to have a git client installed prior, as the soap module being used it pulled directly from Github.)
```
npm install groupwise
```

In your app.js file:

```
var GWS = require('groupwise');
var gws = new GWS();
```

On method callbacks, the error object this contain these parameters:
 - message: A general statement of the error
 - err: If the error was produced by an external module, its error will be placed into here
 - params: Contains the parameters that was passed into the method.
 
 
Events generated by the modules are as follows

 - gws.on('error'): general error notification
 - gws.on('init'): notify that the soap client was created successfully
 - gws.on('login'): notify that the soap client has logged into the server
 - gws.on('logout'): notify that the soap client has logged out of the server
 
 
Current Methods:
 
 - gws.init()
 - gws.login()
 - gws.logout()
 - gws.getFolders()
 - gws.getCalendar()
 - gws.getGlobalAddressBook()
