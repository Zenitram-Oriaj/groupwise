A simple node module for connecting to a Novell Groupwise Server using SOAP.
It was written primarily for the purpose of get a "Resource" calendar's events to display on a touch panel outside a room.

Currently this module is not functioning. Do not use until notified.
This is my very first public module, so it may have lots of issues and not well written. Its a learning process.


On method callbacks, the error object this contain these parameters:
 - message: A general statement of the error
 - err: If the error was produced for an external module, its error will be placed into here
 - params: Contains the parameters that was passed into the method.
 
 
Events generated by the modules are:
 .on('error'): 
 
 .on('init'):
